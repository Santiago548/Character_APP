                <ul>
                    <li><h4>Create a background for your character</h4>
                        <ul>
                        Our realities are shaped by where we’ve been, where we are, and where we want to go.
                        That being said, the one with the most influence on our lives is where we’ve been – our past.
                        The same is likely true for your character. Based on what their life was like prior to the start of your novel, they’ll have different interests, quirks, fears, and more.
                        Your job is to fill out what their life has looked like up until the beginning of your book.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Give your character strengths and weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                        One of the biggest means of influence over your characters will be their strengths or weaknesses.
                        We, as humans, constantly face our strengths and weaknesses on a daily basis, even in the smallest of forms.
                        What your characters are good at and what they’re not great at will affect how they perceive different events, what actions they choose to take, and can affect their overall character arc (which we’ll touch on later).
                        If your character’s strength is talking to strangers and gaining their trust, this might be an asset for them throughout their journey. However, if that is your character’s weakness and they’re forced to do so, it can cause conflict for them.
                        These strengths and weaknesses will shape your character arc and the plot as a whole, so know them well before writing.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Create nervous ticks for your character</h4>
                        <ul>
                        If you’ve paid attention to humans for long enough, you’re aware that we all have certain habits we don’t even realize we’re doing when we’re nervous.
                        Me? I pick at the skin around my nails. It’s a pain (literally) and I never notice I’m doing it until later.
                        This can be a key characteristic that will make your characters feel more real and help make them more relatable to your readers, which will make them want to give you those 5-star reviews.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Avoid making a “perfect” character</h4>
                        <ul>
                        It can be really hard to write your favorite fictional person as having flaws. After all, we want people to love them, right?
                        But a “perfect” character is not lovable – they’re hateable because it’s not realistic.
                        The more you try to make your character “flawless,” the less readers can relate and therefore, they’ll like them less. You have to build flaws into your character just like we all have drawbacks in real like. You need to let your characters fail.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Give your character realistic motives</h4>
                        <ul>
                        No matter which character they or what they want in your story, they need to have a real and valid reason for feeling this way.
                        Take He Who Shall Not Be Named from Harry Potter for example.
                        Voldemort (woops!) wants to kill Harry. That much we should all know – even if you’ve never read or seen the movies. But if he was just trying to kill Harry Potter for the sake of murdering a child, it wouldn’t’ make sense.
                        Yes, he’s evil, but he also has a valid reason for wanting him dead, right?
                        He has to kill Harry Potter because he’s the only person who was able to defeat him before – and because the prophecy says so.
                        If your characters – no matter how minor they are – don’t have a motive that makes sense, readers will be pulled out of the story and end up questioning what’s happening, and not in a good way.
                        This is largely how plot holes arise so in order to avoid them, stick to this character development method.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Give them a unique feature</h4>
                        <ul>
                        This is particularly for those of you writing Game of Thrones-esque novels with a large number of characters, but it’s important for others as well.
                        When writing a book, you want your readers to easily visualize and differentiate the cast. You want each character to stand out as individuals.
                        character development tips
                        A perfect way to do this is to give each person an identifiable feature.
                        For example, let’s use Harry Potter again because you probably know what the main characters look like.
                        Harry has glasses. Hermione has buck teeth (up until she has them shortened a bit too much – and this is only in the books for those of you about to argue), and Ron has flaming red hair.
                        These are very distinct features that can help you picture them as wildly different characters.
                        Now, you don’t have to give each and every character some crazy hair color or style, but try not to have your entire cast look the same.
                        If you have a main character with brown wavy hair, have the next with blonde curly hair, etc.
                        Keep in mind that siblings can certainly look similar!
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Develop a wide variety of character personalities</h4>
                        Meaning, don’t create all of your characters to be the “dark and sarcastic” type or the “tough guy” type.
                        You have to have a wide variety of personalities – just like in the real world.
                        You can even back up their personality with real-life psychology. As an example, I have two characters who both have a tragic background.
                        However, they don’t process that trauma in the same way. One character takes on a very withdrawn approach while the other hides his pain with humor. This gives them very different personalities despite having similar histories.
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Create an impact of your character’s past</h4>
                        <ul>
                        This is when some research will come into play, which should be required anyway. Looking into some psychological effects of trauma can help you accurately and realistically dive into character development.
                        Now, not all characters go through trauma, but there are other big life events that can shape how they behave.
                        If you have a character whose parents were very strict growing up, they may be a bit of a rebel and lack the decision making abilities others have – mostly because they never learned how since their parents made those choices for them.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Make secondary characters foil types</h4>
                        <ul>
                        This is largely to help with personality contract within your novel. Most of the time, this will happen naturally if you’re giving each character a unique personality but it’s great to keep in mind anyway.
                        If you have secondary characters (characters who get a decent amount of page time but are not main characters), craft their personality types to show the opposite of the main characters’.
                        Why? Because you want to firstly create more diversity and secondly, create some non-plot-specific conflict.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Give each character a unique voice</h4>
                        <ul>
                        We all speak differently and that means your characters should too. Depending on where they’re from, they could have different accents, slang, and even phrases they tend to use regularly.
                        Think of a friend of yours for a minute. What are some specific phrases they use a lot?
                        It’s likely you were able to think of something in just a few seconds because it’s so unique to them and something they say a lot.
                        Your characters should be developed in the same way.
                        If you write two characters from very different areas of the world and they have the same style of speaking, your audience will be pulled out of the story because it’s not realistic. Their voices have to be consistent and not the same.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Create a diverse character cast</h4>
                        <ul>
                        I’ll be honest, there is a very real problem in literature when it comes to diversity.
                        You can debate this all you want, but coming from someone who reads many books, it’s a very real issue that only you and other writers going forward can correct.
                        Your book should be just as diverse as the real world.
                        If you don’t have characters with varying skin, hair, or eye colors along with varying body types, disabilities, and even mental illnesses, your characters are not diverse enough.
                        You do not have to write a book about these things in order for you to include them in your novel.
                        For example, one of my main characters has high levels of anxiety. His storyline does not revolve around this mental illness, but it is there, seen, and can affect his plot.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Avoid character stereotypes</h4>
                        <ul>
                        This is really a “do not do” tip versus a “must do” tip. The reason for this is because so many writers feel as though they need a “side character” (or even a main character) but is too lazy to do the real work.
                        Which means they create a stereotype of a specific type of person that can oftentimes be harmful without the author even knowing.
                        A great way to ensure you never have offensive stereotyped characters is to use a sensitivity reader or make sure you have a diverse group of beta readers who can speak on behalf of the characters you’ve developed.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </div>
